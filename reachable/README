In order to extract which mutants are reachable by which test case, we need to run the instrumented code first.
For this we need an sql database to be in place!!!

# Step 0: have an SQL database in place

# Step 1: build the project (after running the reachable option of the tool)

# step 2: run the reachable.sh script
This setups the database, runs the project for each test, and stores which mutants are reachable per test.
Examples are included in the repository

# step 3: run the schemata_quick script
For each mutant, this then runs only those tests that reach the mutant


Timing should be done external, this can be done with the timecmd as provided in the schemata folder.
