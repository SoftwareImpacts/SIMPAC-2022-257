# there are different configurations for the tool, these can be configured by changing the respectable flags inside the main file
1: EXPORT_MUTANTS
2: EXPORT_REACHABLE_MUTANTS
3: SCHEMATA
4: SPLIT_STREAM


# to build the tool, set the desired flags, build it, and rename to your option, e.g. export, the execute your option, ideally using a script

make all
mv rewriter.o export.o
./export.o -p <buildPath> [list of flies to mutate]

You can obtain the list of all files as described int the global README example, or specify files of interest.
An example is provided in export_miniexample.sh and others 


# the EXPORT_MUTANTS option exports the mutants to a csv file.
This is used to executed the mutants in a traditional manner, see README of traditional

# the EXPORT_REACHABLE_MUTANTS option extracts the reachable mutants from the project, for this the code base is instrumented 
See README of reachable

# the SCHEMATA option instruments the code to enable mutant schemata
See README of schemata


# the SPLIT_STREAM option instruments the code to enable split stream mutation testing
This is similar to schemata

# you can export the mutants while having the schemata of split stream option enabled
