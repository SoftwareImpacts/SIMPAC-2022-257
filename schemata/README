To run the schemata technique, the tool should be build with the schemata option.
Running the compiled program instruments the codebase.
We first need to compile the instrumented program, and then rub the schemata script

# step 1: compile instrumented program
cd miniexample/build
cmake --build .


#step 2: run schemata script
./schemata.sh <csvFile> <buildFolder> "testCMD" timeoutSeconds

An example is provided in miniexample.sh and others.

You need to time the execution yourself, this can be done as presented in the timecmd.txt file.
